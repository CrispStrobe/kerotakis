# Kerotakis — GUI roadmap: one bench, one dial, five platforms

Status: 2026-08-24. Companion to `ROADMAP-Webapp.md` (backend/science) and
`CAPABILITIES.md` (CAP tasks). This document decides the client architecture
and the user experience for the real virtual lab: Web, Windows, macOS, iOS,
Android (Linux desktop falls out for free). It is subordinate to the
distribution and licensing invariant in `ROADMAP-Webapp.md`: every UI
dependency must pass the permissive allowlist (MIT / Apache-2.0 / BSD /
ISC / Zlib / CC0 and legal equivalents; no GPL, LGPL, MPL, or ShareAlike
anywhere in a shipping payload).

## Executive decision

**Build one UI, in web standards, and ship it five ways.**

- The UI is a single TypeScript + Svelte application rendering the bench as
  SVG with a Canvas2D effects layer. No 3D, no game engine.
- **Web**: the existing PWA grows into it. Engine = `kerotakis-wasm` +
  IPhreeQC in one module Web Worker (this is OPT-11; the GUI depends on it).
- **Desktop (Windows/macOS/Linux)** and **mobile (iOS/Android)**: the same
  UI in a **Tauri v2** shell (MIT/Apache-2.0), with the Rust core compiled
  **natively** and run in-process on a background thread — no wasm penalty,
  real threads for CAP-2 sweeps and CAP-8 Monte Carlo, memory-mapped data
  packs.
- The UI never talks to the engine directly. It talks to an **`EngineHost`
  protocol** — the same JSON contract in both transports. The web worker and
  the Tauri command layer are two ~200-line implementations of one interface.

**The UX thesis: the register dial is the product.** The engine already
renders the same computation at lv1 ("what you see"), lv2 ("equations and
amounts"), and lv3 ("everything"). The GUI extends that dial from prose to
the entire interface — layout, vocabulary, numerals, chart density — so a
nine-year-old and a graduate student use *the same app on the same bench*,
one turn of a dial apart. We do not build a kids' app and a pro app. A child
grows up inside the same application, and the dial is mid-session switchable
on a running experiment: that demonstration ("turn the dial and the cloudy
beaker becomes a speciation table") is the product's signature move.

## Why this stack and not the alternatives

The decisive constraints:

1. **Five targets, one small team.** Any per-platform UI multiplies work 5×.
2. **Schools run Chromebooks and old Androids.** The web target is not a
   checkbox; for the largest classroom population it *is* the product. That
   disqualifies any framework whose web story is second-class.
3. **Licence allowlist.** No LGPL (Qt out), no GPL-or-commercial dual
   (Slint out), no MPL.
4. **The engine's outputs are text-, table-, and chart-shaped.** A lab app
   is 80 % documents, tables, forms, and typography, 20 % scene. That favors
   DOM/SVG over immediate-mode or game-engine rendering.
5. **Accessibility is non-negotiable for a school product.** A real DOM
   gives screen readers, keyboard nav, IME, localization, and font scaling
   for free; every canvas-first framework reimplements them poorly.

| Candidate | Licence | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| **Web UI + Tauri v2 shells** | MIT/Apache throughout | **Chosen.** Reuses the shipped PWA and wasm path; system webviews keep binaries ~5 MB; native Rust core on installed targets erases the wasm→JS marshalling cost (OPT-11/OPT-9 remain web-only concerns). Tauri v2 mobile is stable since late 2024. |
| Flutter | BSD-3 | Strong mobile, but web is CanvasKit: multi-MB runtime, weak a11y/SEO, poor text selection — unacceptable for the Chromebook population. Adds Dart beside Rust. Duplicates the existing web investment. |
| egui | MIT/Apache | Right for an expert instrument panel, wrong for a child-facing product: immediate-mode text layout, IME, and a11y (AccessKit helps but trails DOM) are weak; mobile is DIY. Rejected as the app, fine for internal debug tools. |
| Dioxus / Leptos (Rust UI) | MIT/Apache | Keeps one language, but mobile is immature and the ecosystem (charts, testing, a11y tooling) is a fraction of TS's. The JSON `EngineHost` boundary means the UI language choice is not load-bearing; choose the ecosystem. |
| Bevy / Godot | MIT | A virtual lab sounds like a game, but the content is tables, equations, provenance, and prose. Game engines make the 20 % scene easy and the 80 % document layer hard, ship large web builds, and have weak a11y. Rejected. |
| Qt, Slint, Compose Multiplatform | LGPL / GPL-dual / Apache | Qt and Slint fail the allowlist outright. Compose's web target is alpha and it adds Kotlin. Rejected. |

**Hedge:** because the UI is a standards-compliant web app first, the shells
are replaceable. If Tauri mobile disappoints on old school Androids, the
identical UI ships in a thin hand-rolled WKWebView/Android WebView wrapper,
or stays a PWA on that platform. No UI work is hostage to the shell choice.

### Frontend dependency allowlist (all require LIC source records before use)

| Dependency | Licence | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Tauri v2 (+ wry, tao) | MIT OR Apache-2.0 | Desktop + mobile shells |
| TypeScript | Apache-2.0 | UI language |
| Svelte 5 + Vite | MIT | UI framework + build (compiles away; smallest runtime of the mainstream options — this is the low-end-device pick; React/Solid acceptable substitutes if contributor pool demands) |
| d3-scale, d3-shape, d3-interpolate | ISC | Chart primitives under the CAP-3 renderer (no d3 megabundle) |
| Lucide icons | ISC | Iconography |
| vitest + Playwright | MIT | Test harness |
| System font stack | — | No shipped fonts: smaller payload, native feel, no OFL review needed. Revisit only if typography demands it. |

Explicitly avoided: chart libraries with MPL/proprietary tiers (Highcharts,
AG-Grid), moment/luxon-style locale megabundles, any CSS framework — the
design system is bespoke and tiny, themed by CSS custom properties (the
current PWA palette is the seed).

## The UX

### One bench, three registers, one dial

The register dial is permanent UI — a three-position control, always visible,
top-level. It changes *presentation*, never *simulation*: same vessels, same
ledger, same events.

| | lv1 — Look | lv2 — Measure | lv3 — Model |
|---|---|---|---|
| Audience center | ~9–13, curious adults | secondary / intro college | experts, teachers, developers |
| Bench | full-bleed, big targets, playful apparatus | same scene + numeric badges (T, pH, V) on vessels | same scene + gauges, saturation chips, boundary annotations |
| Amounts | "a pinch, a spoonful, a cup" (the engine already parses these) | grams, moles, mL with unit-aware input | full quantity grammar, tolerances, uncertainty |
| Events | narrated observations: "It went cloudy!" | + balanced equations, quantities | + speciation deltas, model provenance, routing reasons |
| Numbers | hidden until asked | shown | shown with uncertainty and confidence class |
| Instruments | qualitative ("warm", "very acidic") | numeric readouts, live charts | + calibration, detection limits, noise model (R6) |
| Extra surfaces | lesson story cards | notebook with tables, chart export | command bar, provenance drawer, studies, diagrams |

Vocabulary, sentence length, and layout density are register functions. The
engine already owns the prose problem per register; the GUI extends the same
switch to chrome and controls.

### The five surfaces

All responsive states of one component set — desktop shows them side by
side, a phone shows bench + bottom sheets.

**1. The Bench** (center). Vessels drawn as 2-D *cross-sections* — a
deliberate choice over 3-D: a cross-section shows what the chemistry teaches
(liquid color and depth, precipitate layers, headspace volume and pressure,
electrode surfaces, condenser path) and what a photorealistic render hides.
Liquid color comes from the engine's computed spectra (`appearance.rs` /
`spectrum.rs`) — Beer–Lambert over the actual path length of the drawn
vessel, so a wider beaker really reads darker. Precipitates accumulate as
textured layers (never color-only encoding). Bubbles, venting, and steam are
a Canvas2D effects layer driven by event data, decorative in style but never
in *fact* — no effect fires without a computed event behind it.

Apparatus snaps to sockets: hotplate under a vessel, burette above, condenser
between two, electrodes + supply + wires (R4), separatory funnel (R2). The
apparatus palette grows exactly as the roadmap's apparatus models land;
nothing appears on the shelf before it has a model behind it.

**2. The Shelf** (left / bottom drawer). The species registry, searchable,
with formula, computed appearance swatch, phase icon, and hazard chips —
served by the existing `species()` JSON, whose doc comment already says
"what a UI offers on a shelf". Drag onto a vessel (or tap-tap on touch),
then an amount picker whose units follow the register. Model packs appear
here as installable shelf sections.

**3. The Feed / Notebook** (right / bottom sheet). The rendered event
stream — the same lines the CLI prints, at the current register. This
surface is triple-duty:

- it is the **lab notebook**: autosaved, timestamped, exportable to
  Markdown/PDF with charts inline;
- it is the **accessibility surface**: the entire lab is, by construction,
  a legible text document; a screen-reader user runs the whole bench from
  the feed plus the command bar and loses nothing that matters;
- it is the **teaching mirror**: every GUI gesture prints the operator
  command it compiled to (`add v1 NaCl 5.8g`) alongside its narrated result,
  so the GUI continuously teaches the scripting language.

**4. The Inspector** (tap a vessel). Register-dependent detail: lv1 gets a
picture and one sentence; lv2 gets contents, amounts, and measurements; lv3
gets the full `inspect` tables — speciation, activities, γ, SI, the
conserved ledger, and a **provenance drawer**: which model computed this,
from which dataset, why routing chose it, and where its validity ends
(rendered from the R0 capability/validity reports when they land).

**5. The Command Bar** (⌘K / `/`). The full command grammar with completion,
inline validation (via a parse-only engine endpoint), and history. It is the
keyboard path for accessibility, the expert's fast path, and the CLI-parity
guarantee. The current terminal PWA is this surface's ancestor and remains
available as a "console" view.

### Interaction principles

1. **Direct manipulation compiles to operators.** Every drag, pour, and knob
   emits a command from the *same grammar* the CLI parses; the GUI holds no
   chemistry state of its own. One source of truth; CLI/TUI/GUI/MCP parity
   is structural, not maintained; every session **is** a `.lab` script.
2. **Undo is replay.** The engine is deterministic and the operator log is
   authoritative, so undo/redo = replay a log prefix (server-side snapshot
   caching keeps it O(1) in practice). The same machinery gives a **timeline
   scrubber** — drag back through an experiment — and lesson playback.
3. **Observation before explanation.** lv1 shows what you would see;
   the equation, the mechanism, and the numbers are each one tap deeper,
   never forced on the learner and never withheld from them.
4. **Hazards teach.** A hazard verdict interrupts with a card that warns
   precisely, then offers *show me why* — running the chloramine formation
   the warning describes. Prohibition without demonstration teaches nothing
   (the engine's own philosophy; the UI must not flatten it into a toast).
5. **Honest boundaries are first-class UI.** `unsupported` / outside-validity
   outcomes render as a distinct "the model can't say" panel — visually
   unmistakable from an error and from a null result. The confidence
   vocabulary (`computed` / `curated-family` / `curated-instance` /
   `estimated` / `qualitative` / `unsupported`) gets one fixed visual
   encoding (badge + border treatment) used everywhere a number appears.
6. **Everything leaves the app.** Notebook → Markdown/PDF; charts → SVG/PNG
   (the CAP-3 contract renders identically in-app and to file); session →
   `.lab`; state → JSON. Nothing a learner makes is trapped.

### Modes over the same bench

- **Sandbox** — the default. The bench, the shelf, no fence.
- **Lessons** — the 16 lessons (and the codex curriculum graph) as an
  overlay on the *real* bench: each step is a real command the learner
  performs (or watches run); deviation is allowed and diffed ("you added
  twice the salt — look what didn't change"); return-to-script is one tap.
  The curriculum graph renders as a map screen — at lv1 it reads as a
  skill tree, at lv3 as the DAG it is.
- **Challenges** — assessment the engine can mark: balance this equation
  (the balancer already lints the codex), identify the unknown ion (R6 wet
  tests), make a buffer hold pH against 10 mmol of acid, hit the titration
  endpoint within 0.5 mL. Verification is computed, never answer-keyed.
- **Studies** (lv3, rides CAP-2/3/4/8) — parameter sweeps, live-drawn
  titration curves, predominance/Pourbaix diagrams, Monte Carlo bands.
  The GUI here is a thin form + the CAP-3 chart renderer; the engine does
  everything.

### Classroom and privacy posture

No account required, no telemetry by default, fully offline after install
(PWA service worker already exists; Tauri bundles everything). Sessions save
locally; a teacher collects exported notebooks/`.lab` files. Multi-user sync,
classrooms-as-a-service, and cloud saves are **non-goals** for this roadmap.

### Accessibility and localization

- The feed + command bar make the app operable and legible without the
  pointer or the canvas; the bench SVG additionally carries ARIA labels and
  keyboard focus for every socket and vessel.
- Color never carries meaning alone: computed colors are paired with the
  engine's color names; precipitates and phases get texture and shape.
- Touch targets ≥ 44 px; the whole lv1 register is one-hand phone operable.
- Localization is an engine question before a UI question: prose currently
  renders engine-side in English. The typed `Event` enum is the fix — expose
  events as structured JSON (id + params) and move register rendering into
  locale packs (engine-side tables or client-side, decided in GUI-002).
  UI chrome is trivially localizable from day one; event prose follows.

```

- The UI is a pure projection of `(scene JSON, events JSON, state JSON)`;
  it holds interaction state only. All engine calls are async in both hosts,
  so the UI code cannot tell the transports apart and never blocks.
- **Scene JSON** is the one new engine contract of consequence: a versioned,
  per-vessel render model — liquid volume + sRGB color (+ path-length
  basis), precipitate layers, bubbles/venting flags, headspace P/V, T,
  attached apparatus, boundary condition. Most fields exist in `state()` and
  `appearance` today; this formalizes them so native and web render
  identically and golden tests can pin them.
- **Events as data**: `step()` returns the typed events as JSON alongside
  (eventually instead of) prose; the register renderer becomes callable on
  both sides of the boundary during migration.
- **Determinism is a test asset**: scene JSON over replayed `.lab` scripts
  gives golden-file UI tests (DOM snapshot per step per register) with no
  flakiness; Playwright drives the five canonical lessons per release.

## Performance budgets (CI-gated, per the backend roadmap's low-end mandate)

| Budget | Target device: 2018-class Chromebook / Android 10 WebView |
|---|---|
| Cold start to interactive bench (web, cached SW) | < 3 s |
| Core payload (UI + wasm + aqueous pack, gzipped) | < 6 MB; further packs on demand |
| Engine call round trip (UI-visible) | UI paints an optimistic "working" state < 100 ms, always |
| Main-thread long tasks during a step | 0 (engine fully off-thread in both hosts) |
| Bench frame budget with effects | 60 fps desktop, 30 fps floor on target device; effects degrade first, data never |
| Tauri bundle (desktop) | < 15 MB installed |

## Execution

Ordered, dependency-honest, one reviewable change each. `LIC` gates apply to
every new dependency before its first import.

### Phase G0 — Contracts (no visible UI change)

- [ ] **GUI-001 — `EngineHost` protocol v1.** Specify the JSON contract
  (step/runScript/state/scene/events/species/parse/chart) as a versioned
  document + conformance test that both hosts must pass. The current wasm
  API is the seed.
  *Status 2026-08-24 (2nd pass): spec written — [PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md).
  Conformance runs against BOTH shipping hosts: the CLI/MCP surface
  (`crates/kerotakis-cli/tests/protocol_conformance.rs`, in the test
  suite) and the wasm host (`tools/test-protocol-conformance.mjs`,
  919 structural checks over the lesson corpus, wired into the CI wasm
  job) — one shape, drift fails before a client sees it. Open for the
  checkbox: the same suite against TauriHost once the shell builds
  (GUI-030), and hello's remaining fields.*
- [ ] **GUI-002 — Events as structured JSON.** Expose the typed `Event`
  enum over the boundary with stable ids + params; decide engine-side vs
  client-side register rendering and the locale-pack shape.
- [ ] **GUI-003 — Scene JSON v1.** Per-vessel render model derived from
  existing state + appearance; golden-file tests over replayed lessons.
  *Status 2026-08-24: implemented — `kerotakis-core/src/scene.rs` (liquid
  colour+word, solids with metallic/precipitate split, headspace, badges,
  lv1 words), shape-pinning + behaviour tests in-module, wired into the
  wasm `step`/`run_script` responses and `Lab::scene()`. Open for the
  checkbox: goldens over the replayed lesson corpus (folds into GUI-001's
  conformance suite).*
- [ ] **GUI-004 — One-worker web engine.** Land OPT-11 (lab + IPhreeQC in a
  single module worker) behind `WorkerHost`; the current PWA runs on it
  unchanged. Measure; OPT-9 only if numbers demand.
- [ ] **GUI-005 — Parse-only endpoint.** Validate a command without
  executing (for live input validation and drag-legality preview).

### Phase G1 — The bench, on the web

- [ ] **GUI-010 — App shell.** Svelte + Vite + TS scaffold in `web/`,
  PWA/service worker carried over; the terminal view survives as "console".
  *Status 2026-08-24: scaffold landed in `web/app/` — EngineHost client
  layer (`RequestChannel` correlation, `WorkerHost`, engine worker over
  the WEB-002 envelope; 6 vitest tests green), Session store, first
  Bench/Vessel SVG painting Scene JSON v1, Feed (aria-live notebook),
  CommandBar, RegisterDial; npm licence lint (73 packages allowlisted);
  production build 19 KB gzip. Open for the checkbox: PWA/service-worker
  carry-over, build-web.sh integration, and the console view.*
- [ ] **GUI-011 — Bench canvas v1.** SVG vessels with computed color,
  precipitate layers, headspace, temperature badges; scene-JSON-driven;
  register dial wired end to end.
- [ ] **GUI-012 — Shelf v1.** Registry-driven, searchable, drag/tap-to-add,
  register-aware amount picker (pinch/cup ↔ g/mol/mL).
  *Status 2026-08-24: tap-to-add landed (`Shelf.svelte`) — registry-fed via
  `species`, search over name/formula/key, register-aware quick amounts
  (lv1 kitchen units, lv2+ lab units + free input), compiles to
  `add v{n} …` through the session. Open: drag-to-vessel, hazard chips,
  appearance swatches.*
- [ ] **GUI-013 — Feed v1.** Event stream at current register with command
  echo; this is also the a11y acceptance gate: run a full lesson from
  keyboard + screen reader.
- [ ] **GUI-014 — Inspector v1 + command bar.** Register-dependent detail;
  ⌘K bar with completion from the grammar + parse-only validation.
  *Status 2026-08-24: Inspector v1 landed — tap a vessel (vessels are
  buttons, keyboard-operable) for `inspect` detail at the current
  register, refreshed after every step and register switch, with a
  particles append. Open: completion + parse-only validation in the bar
  (waits on GUI-005).*
- [ ] **GUI-015 — Undo/replay + timeline.** Log-prefix replay with snapshot
  cache; timeline scrubber; session autosave/restore; `.lab` import/export.
  *Status 2026-08-24 (2nd pass): undo/redo/scrubber are one cursor over
  the replayed log (jumpTo = reset + prefix replay; range-input timeline
  in the header; mid-history commands truncate the future); autosave to
  localStorage with replay-based restore, corrupt saves dropped; `.lab`
  export AND import (import composes onto the current bench, stops at
  the first rejected line naming file:line, fully undoable); `clear`
  distinct from jumpTo(0). All vitest-pinned. Open: snapshot cache for
  O(1) undo on long sessions.*

- [ ] **GUI-016 — Test deploy.** One payload from `tools/build-web.sh` —
  console at `/`, app at `/app/`, cross-linked, one shared engine — pushed
  to a Vercel preview (token + team scope per the machine's
  vercel-deploys.md, prebuilt static, no build on Vercel's side) and to
  GitHub Pages. "Switchable" is two links, not a framework; when the app
  reaches parity (end of G1) the surfaces swap places: app at `/`, console
  at `/console/`. Blocked only on a local `wasm-bindgen-cli 0.2.127`
  install + emsdk sourcing after the cargo lock frees.
- [ ] **GUI-017 — Continuous deploy.** `.github/workflows/pages.yml`
  (added: builds the payload with the same recipe ci.yml already uses and
  deploys to Pages on web-affecting pushes + manual dispatch); the Vercel
  production deploy stays a deliberate manual step until the register dial
  UX is demo-ready. The service worker now precaches the app's hashed
  assets (stamped by build-web.sh), so both surfaces are offline-first
  from one install; `web/vercel.json` pins immutable caching for hashed
  assets.

### Phase G2 — Learning surfaces

- [ ] **GUI-020 — Lesson player.** Lessons as guided overlays with
  deviation + return; curriculum graph as map screen.
- [ ] **GUI-021 — Charts.** CAP-3 contract renderer (d3 primitives); first
  chart is the live titration curve (with CAP-12); SVG/PNG export.
  *Status 2026-08-24: renderer half done, dependency-free (hand-rolled
  scales/ticks beat adding d3 for one curve): Chart JSON v1 is specified
  in PROTOCOL.md, `Chart.svelte` renders it (nice ticks, uncertainty
  bands for CAP-8, confidence-encoded strokes, screen-reader data table,
  SVG export; core vitest-covered), and the feed renders any step
  carrying `charts` today. Open: the engine emitting the contract
  (CAP-3's other half, with CAP-12's titrate verb) and PNG export.*
- [ ] **GUI-022 — Notebook export.** Markdown/PDF with inline charts and
  provenance footer.
  *Status 2026-08-24: Markdown half done (`notebook.ts` + "save notes") —
  commands as code, observations as prose, hazards as severity-labelled
  quotes, charts as data tables with provenance. Open: PDF, inline chart
  images.*
- [ ] **GUI-023 — Hazard cards + honest-boundary panels.** The fixed visual
  encoding for the confidence vocabulary, everywhere.
- [ ] **GUI-024 — Challenges v1.** Equation balancing, endpoint, buffer
  hold; engine-marked.

- [ ] **GUI-025 — The equation strip.** Reactions as balanced equations
  pinned beside the bench at lv2+, live as they happen. We already
  compute them; today they are buried in the feed.
- [ ] **GUI-026 — Pour and stir.** Drop-to-add gets a pour animation and
  a stir gesture on the Canvas2D effects layer — strictly driven by
  computed events, decorative in style, never in fact. Today the reagent
  teleports; a lab should *feel* like handling things.
- [ ] **GUI-027 — Utilities drawer.** Surface `kero calc` (CAP-5 named
  relations), property correlations (CAP-6), and unit conversion in the
  GUI — the glossary + converter + calculator drawer teachers actually
  use, backed by computed values with provenance.
- [ ] **GUI-028 — Voice input.** Speech-to-command over the existing
  grammar (Web Speech API, progressive enhancement, browser-gated), with
  the parse endpoint validating live — voice access serves students who
  cannot use a physical lab or a keyboard, and a command language is
  uniquely suited to it.

### What the virtual-lab genre teaches (survey 2026-08-24, contenders
deliberately unnamed here)

The genre spans touch-first mobile benches (tactile pours, live
equation displays, outcome-pair chemistry), the freeware worktable
generation (drag-drop plus a utilities drawer), VR platform vendors
(assessment analytics as the selling point), scripted 3D academic labs
(catalogs of 100+ canned experiments, animated tutor characters), and
database-driven browser simulators (thousands of reaction rows, voice
input, procedure training). Every one of them runs on a script or a
lookup table, and each plateaus exactly at its catalog — the limitation
lists read "these procedures are not in the database." None combines
computed chemistry + one app from child to expert + web/offline-first +
an open licence; that intersection is ours. Adopted from the genre:
GUI-025..028 above. Rejected as recorded decisions: 3D environment
fidelity, VR-first, and animated agent characters (the narration feed
is the agent). The honest gap the genre exposes is content volume — the
lesson corpus, not the GUI, is the competitive lever there (codex
work).

### Phase G3 — Desktop

- [ ] **GUI-030 — TauriHost.** Native core behind the protocol; conformance
  suite green on Win/macOS/Linux.
- [ ] **GUI-031 — Desktop shell.** `.lab` file association, native
  open/save, menu/shortcuts, offline pack manager (signed manifests per
  LIC-009).
- [ ] **GUI-032 — Payload audit.** SBOM + notices for the Tauri bundles
  (extends LIC-008/LIC-012).

### Phase G4 — Mobile

- [ ] **GUI-040 — Android first** (the school-device population), then iOS:
  Tauri v2 mobile builds, touch polish pass, one-hand lv1 audit,
  WebView-version floor decided from telemetry-free field testing.
- [ ] **GUI-041 — Store payloads.** Official binaries under the Section 7
  permission (LIC-001/002 already resolved); store-review dry run.
- [ ] **GUI-042 — Fallback decision point.** If Tauri mobile misses the
  budgets on target hardware, wrap the identical UI in a plain
  WKWebView/WebView shell; the protocol makes this a shell swap.

### Phase G5 — Expert surfaces

- [ ] **GUI-050 — Studies UI** over CAP-2 (sweeps) with CAP-3 rendering.
- [ ] **GUI-051 — Diagrams** (CAP-4 predominance/Pourbaix) and **Monte
  Carlo bands** (CAP-8) in the chart renderer.
- [ ] **GUI-052 — Provenance drawer** rendering the R0 capability/validity
  reports and the property-resolution ladder rung per number.

Continuous, all phases: a11y audit per surface; perf budgets in CI on a
throttled target profile; golden scene/DOM tests over the lesson corpus;
every new dependency through the LIC checklist before first import.

## Non-goals

- 3-D rendering, photorealism, or a game engine — the cross-section teaches
  more and costs an order of magnitude less.
- Accounts, cloud sync, classroom management, telemetry.
- A separate kids' edition — the dial is the product; forking the audience
  forks the codebase and betrays the register idea.
- Native per-platform UI rewrites (SwiftUI/Compose) — revisit only if a
  platform's webview floor proves untenable *and* the platform matters
  commercially.
- Investing in the TUI beyond debugging parity — it remains a developer
  surface.
